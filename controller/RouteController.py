    Base class for routing policy

    To implement a scheduling algorithm, implement the make_decisions() method.
    Please use the boilerplate code from the example, and implement your algorithm between
    the 'Your algo...' comments.

    make_decisions takes in a list of vehicles and network information (connection_info).
        Using this data, it should return a dictionary of {vehicle_id: decision}, where "decision"
        is one of the directions defined by SUMO (see constants above). Any scheduling algorithm
        may be injected into the simulation, as long as it is wrapped by the RouteController class
        and implements the make_decisions method.
